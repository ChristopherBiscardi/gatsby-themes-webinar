# What are Themes?

</SectionInverted>

<Notes>

* Themes are a powerful new abstraction under development for Gatsby. They allow
  a developer to package up a site as a standalone product for others to use.
* In short: Themes are NPM installable Gatsby sites.
* As we go through the presentation: We'll go deeper into what this means

</Notes>

---

# Themes?

* Token Swaps
* CSS Zen Garden

<Notes>

* purely ui: aka "dark mode"
* CSS stylesheet swap or "a new coat of paint"
* Typically one theme. Functionality addition, configuration

</Notes>

---

# Wordpress/Hugo/etc

* Single Theme
* Comes with a visual style
* Adds Functionality

<Notes>

* One theme, installed by vendoring
* Themes sometimes come with "visual packs"
* Turn WP blog into ecommerce store

</Notes>

<Section>
<div>

# What are <sup>(Gatsby)</sup> Themes?
## A new abstraction

</div>
</Section>

<Notes>

* The next level of abstraction for building and maintaining Gatsby projects
* Just as flexible as building a Gatsby site itself, while allowing us to
  encapsulate that flexibility in a way that is easier to consume for our peers.

</Notes>

---

# <sup>(Gatsby)</sup> Themes?

* ~~Token Swaps~~
* CSS Zen Garden<sup>++</sup>


<Notes>

* Token swaps mostly runtime. Can help set up the infra.
* Levels up by introducing "component set swaps" via Component Shadowing.
  - Instead of `divs`, replace Content-Specific components across your entire
    site, like `PostListItem` 

</Notes>

---

# WordPress/Hugo/etc <sup>++</sup>

* ~~Single~~ Theme<sub>s</sub>
* Comes with a visual style
* ~~Adds~~ <sub>composes</sub> Functionality

<Notes>

Gatsby improves by providing:

* Multiple themes, in multiple ways (parent/child & siblings)
* Comes with an integrateable visual style
* Lego block an ecommerce store *and* a separate blog theme

</Notes>

---

<Section>
<div>

# Why themes?

* Ease of use & higher level abstractions

</div>
</Section>

---

# Lifecycle & Action APIs

* `onCreateNode`
* `createPage`
* `sourceNodes`
* `createTypes`
* `wrapRootElement`
* etc...

<Notes>

* Gatsby already has a set of abstractions (Lifecycle & Action APIs -> source &
  transformer plugins)

</Notes>

---

# Issues

* Plugins can't add plugins
* Low level abstractions

<Notes>

* still writing `createPage`
* building a higher level of abstraction
  - write less gatsby-config/gatsby-node
  - We want custom sized Lego blocks of functionality

</Notes>

---

# Who are themes for?

* People new to Gatsby
* People with common use cases
* Entrepreneurs
* Designers

<Notes>

* People new to Gatsby that want to get started quickly without a difficult
  learning curve
* People who have clear and common use-cases in mind for Gatsby (e.g. blog,
  ecommerce, documentation) and want to share the complexity of maintaining the
  underlying functionality with others — so pick a theme as the base for their
  site instead of starting from scratch 
* OSS/Commercial entrepreneurs who want to create web products. Themes will
  enable them to assemble a product they can share or sell with others. 
* Designers who want to create unique/beautiful website designs to share with
  others

# Use Cases

1. I want a Blog
2. Documentation and a Blog 
3. Customize the branding
4. Build Themes to sell
5. Internal Create React App
6. Data Sourcing

<Notes>

1. Just write some markdown and have a blog (`yarn add gatsby-theme-blog`)
2. Just write some markdown and have docs/ a blog (`yarn add gatsby-theme-docz`)
3. Change the tokens (colors, typography, etc)
4. Shadow components for more customization
  - a couple for own project
  - a lot to produce a new theme
5. Apollo (multiple documentation sites, etc)
6. Abstract Data for public theme consumption
  - `type BlogPost` can come from any data source

</Notes>

---
# I want a Blog

```shell
yarn init -y
yarn add gatsby-theme-blog
```


```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  __experimentalThemes: [`gatsby-theme-blog`]
}
```

<Notes>

* read code
* Explain __experimentalThemes

</Notes>


---


# Docs and a Blog

```shell
yarn init -y
yarn add gatsby-theme-blog gatsby-theme-docz
```

<Notes>

* read code

</Notes>

---
# Docs and a Blog

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  __experimentalThemes: [
    `gatsby-theme-blog`,
    `gatsby-theme-docz`
  ]
}
```

<Notes>

You can use multiple themes

</Notes>

---

<FullScreenCode>

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  __experimentalThemes: [{
    resolve: `gatsby-theme-blog`,
    options: {
      colors: {
        black: '#000e1a',
        white: '#fff',
        blue: '#007ce0',
        navy: '#004175'
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

</FullScreenCode>
<Notes>

# Branding

Themes accept options. Using styled-system? set theme

</Notes>

---

# How do Themes work?

* gatsby-config.js
* Overrides and Configuration
* Data

<Notes>

Themes boil down to `gatsby-config.js`.

</Notes>

---

<FullScreenCode>

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
    `gatsby-plugin-emotion`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `pages`,
        path: `src/pages/`,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-source-airtable`,
  ]
}
```

</FullScreenCode>

<Notes>

* Heart of a Gatsby project.

</Notes>

---

<FullScreenCode>

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  __experimentalThemes: [`gatsby-theme-superawesome`],
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-source-airtable`,
  ]
}
```

</FullScreenCode>

<Notes>

* There's sharable logic, and one-off.
* Airtable is only on this one site.
* Every site is built with MDX and Emotion

</Notes>

---

<FullScreenCode>

```js
// gatsby-theme-superawesome's gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
    `gatsby-plugin-emotion`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `pages`,
        path: `src/pages/`,
      },
    },
  ]
}
```

</FullScreenCode>

<Notes>

* congrats you just wrote your first theme
* Everything else emerges from this idea of composing blocks of lower level APIs together.

</Notes>

---

# Overrides and Configuration

* Configuring Themes
* Replacing components
* Extending components

<Notes>

Not everything is perfect out of the box

</Notes>

---

# Configurable Gatsby Config

```
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  __experimentalThemes: [{
    resolve: `gatsby-theme-superblog`,
    options: { tags: [`mdx`, `gatsby`, `pizza`] }
  }]
}
```

<Notes>

* Configure a blog theme to do validation on specific tags

</Notes>

---

<FullScreenCode>

```
// A theme's gatsby-config.js
module.exports = options => {
  const optionalPlugins = []

  if(options.tags) {
    optionalPlugins.push({
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-validate-blogpost`,
      options: { tags: options.tags }
    })
  }

  return {
    plugins
  }
}
```

</FullScreenCode>


<Notes>

* gatsby configs can be a function for themes

</Notes>

---

<FullScreenCode>

```js
// a theme's gatsby-node.js
exports.sourceNodes = ({actions}, themeOptions) => {
  actions.createTypes('enum Tag {'
    + themeOptions.tags.join('\n')
    + '}'
  )
}

// the generated code
enum Tag {
  mdx
  gatsby 
  pizza
}
```

</FullScreenCode>

<Notes>

* We can generate and use types that will break if we use the wrong values by
  configuring it in our theme's usage

</Notes>

---

```
Expected a value of type "Tag" but received: "milk-duds"
```

<Notes>

If we use the tag `milk-duds`, the GraphQL API gives us an error at build time.

# Shadowing

```
.
└── site
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── package.json
    ├── node_modules
    │   └── gatsby-theme-superawesome
    │       └── src
    │           └── components
    │               └── blog-post-item.js
    └── src
        └── gatsby-theme-superawesome
            └── components
                └── blog-post-item.js
```

<Notes>

* Theme uses component `blog-post-item`
* We don't like it, replace with our own
* Shadowed component gets props as usual, is injected into the React tree in the
  same spot as original component

</Notes>

---

# Shadowing

* Works for any webpack'd file in `src/`
* Direct replacement of file

<Notes>

* gets same props, etc

</Notes>

---

<FullScreenCode>

```
// this file is our shadow file in our site
// site/src/gatsby-theme-superawesome/components/blog-post-item.js

// import original component
import BlogPostItem from
'gatsby-theme-superawesome/src/components/blog-post-item.js'

// don't show excerpts
export default props => (
  <BlogPostItem {...props} excerpt="" />
)
```

</FullScreenCode>

<Notes>

## Extending Components

* This approach allows us to upgrade our theme without worrying about breaking as much

</Notes>

---

# Latent Shadowing

1. Multiple themes
2. Shadowing
3. Shadowing themes that could be installed

<Notes>

* Shadowing works in themes and sites
* Gatsby allows multiple themes to be installed
* A theme can add support for other themes by shadowing their files. These files
  won't be used until the other theme is installed.

</Notes>

---

# When all else fails

* Low level APIs

<Notes>

* Can still use the low level APIs like `onCreatePage`

</Notes>

# Themes Roadmap
## and Other Projects

* Data Abstraction
* System UI
* DesignQL
* Theme UI
* Blocks
* CLI improvements

</div>
</Section>

---

# Data Abstraction

* Be able to use themes across sources
* Builds on Schema Customization APIs
* Is still early

---

# Warning: Experimental Ahead

* Themes core is pretty stable
* Shadowing is pretty stable
* Data Abstractions are new
* Everything I'm about to show you *beyond this slide* is not ready for production

---

# System UI

* Design token format spec

<Notes>

* Meant to promote the interoperability of various tools around scale and value definitions
* borne out of styled-system efforts originally

</Notes>

---

# DesignQL

* Reference implementation of System UI Spec
* Generates Documentation
* A base for future work

<Notes>

* generative design
* experimenting with primitives
* inline theme/component editing
* Gatsby Themes can opt-in to this for first-class editor support

</Notes>

---

# Theme UI

* Component Library
* Implements System UI/DesignQL standards
* Will be used for Gatsby official themes
* Currently used on gatsby-theme-digital-garden
* Comes with solutions for scoping, documentation, etc

---

# Blocks

* Open Source Block Editor
* Backed by MDX, an authorable format
* Partner with third parties (design tools, CMSs, etc)

<Notes>

Like: Notion, Dropbox Paper, Google Docs

</Notes>

---

# CLI Improvements

* Shadow ejection and introspection

<Notes>

Shadowing can be a lot to hold in your head when trying to figure out what can
be shadowed and what currently is shadowed. We're working on CLI improvements to
Gatsby to display information about shadowed components as well as make ejecting
specific components easier.

</Notes>

---

<Section>

# Gatsby Themes

* Composable gatsby-configs
* Configurable and Shadowable
* NPM installable
* As modular or monolithic as you want
